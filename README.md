# Smart-Door-Lock
Smart Door Lock is a new idea and innovation about a door that can be opened via a card and/or a smartphone, and will close automatically. This project uses an ultrasonic sensor that will detect someone by the door, and bluetooth connection that will connect smartphone with a module that will control the door.
